## Configuraton
All parameters are stored in `/src/defines.js`
```js

export const COUNT_OF_ROWS = 60
export const CELLS_COLOR = "#7e8bed"
export const MAX_SPEED = 100

## About
I built this project mainly to practice my JavaScript skills.
Code written in "old school" style because I think it's cool.
